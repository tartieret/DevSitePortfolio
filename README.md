# My Personal Portfolio

In my blog I talk about things that I'm working on

This blog uses [Pelican](http://blog.getpelican.com/), a static site generator powered by Python.

## Setup

1. Create a Python 3.10 virtual environment
2. Install the Python requirements using: ```pip install requirements.txt```
3. Activate your environment
4. Run ```pelican content``` to generate the static output
5. Run ```pelican --serve``` to serve the site on localhost
