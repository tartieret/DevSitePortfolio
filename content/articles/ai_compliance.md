AI is moving fast, but expectations around responsibility, transparency, and accountability are catching up just as quickly. What used to be experimental is now part of real products, real decisions, and real risk.

I put together this short deck for the developers on my team as part of a new AI compliance framework. The goal was to give exposure to the key ideas behind upcoming AI regulations in Europe, Canada, and the United States.

Sharing it here in case it’s useful to others building or shipping AI systems today.
