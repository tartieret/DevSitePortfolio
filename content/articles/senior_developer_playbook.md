## Intro

Most developers spend a lot of time building technical skill. Learning frameworks, understanding infrastructure, optimizing performance, designing clean architectures. All of that matters.

Over the years, as I have tried to support and guide developers on my teams, I have found myself reflecting on what actually distinguishes the strongest performers in day-to-day work. The ones who consistently deliver, reduce friction, and make the team more effective.

What stood out was not a particular technology or level of expertise, but a set of behaviors that shaped how work moved through the team and how uncertainty was handled.

This article is an attempt to put those observations into a simple, practical checklist. It is inspired by the highest-performing developers I have worked with, and I hope it can be useful both as a reference for more experienced engineers and as guidance for those earlier in their careers who want to build habits that scale over time.

## A practical playbook to follow

The strongest engineers I have worked with tend to follow a small set of consistent patterns.

- When you are stuck for more than a reasonable amount of time, pause and ask for help. Explain what you tried and what you believe is happening, instead of staying blocked for days.
- When something might impact users, communicate early. Do not wait for full certainty before raising a flag or helping coordinate a response.
- When you identify an issue, make it visible. Log it, track it, and remove the risk that it will be forgotten or rediscovered later.
- When you delegate work, name an explicit owner and a deadline. Responsibility is clear and progress can be followed.
- When work is deferred, escalate explicitly. Do not let risk silently accumulate in the background.
- When planning risky changes such as deployments, maintenance, or migrations, write things down. Define steps, validation checks, rollback paths, and communication expectations.
- When you need a decision validated, frame the problem. Outline viable options, explain trade-offs, and recommend a path forward instead of asking others to do the thinking for you.
- After incidents or maintenance work, document what happened. Capture what went well, what did not, and what should change next time.
- Over time, turn recurring pain points into concrete improvement actions rather than accepting them as normal.

## Why this matters

Seniority is often evaluated primarily through technical skill, such as depth in a stack, system design ability, or problem-solving speed. Those things matter, but they only describe part of the job.

The behaviors in this playbook reflect something broader. They show that someone understands the full extent of the software development process and that it goes well beyond writing code. They are a clear sign of professional maturity and, in my opinion, the real criteria for calling someone “senior.”

These practices directly shape how a team operates. They reduce operational risk, improve response time under pressure, and build trust with users and stakeholders. They prevent the same problems from repeating and free leadership from constant firefighting. Most importantly, they help teams move from reacting to issues to learning from them.

They are also useful much earlier in a career than their label suggests. They are called “senior” mostly because they are rarely taught explicitly. In practice, they create leverage from day one.

They are also resilient to changes in tooling and to the rise of AI. AI can generate code, explore options, and accelerate execution. It does not take responsibility for outcomes. It does not decide when to escalate, when to communicate risk, or how to coordinate people under uncertainty. Reducing ambiguity, increasing clarity, and ensuring work moves to resolution remain human responsibilities.

Developers who consistently follow this playbook tend to deliver better outcomes. They reduce iteration through earlier alignment. They communicate more clearly before, during, and after their work. They ensure progress by identifying and escalating blockers early instead of letting them linger.

Strong individual contributors write good code. High-performing teams are built by developers who lead through example, understand the system they operate in, and make it easier for everyone else to do their best work.
