intro: I'm a product-minded CTO specializing in building and scaling data-intensive platforms for industrial and enterprise applications. Want to know how I may help your project? Check out my <a class="link-on-bg" href="resume.html">resume</a>.

My work sits at the intersection of complex systems, real-time data, and business impact — helping organizations turn operational and energy data into actionable insights.

Over 14 years in software and systems engineering, I’ve led teams, defined technology strategy, and shipped products that operate at scale. My experience spans from zero-to-one platform creation to enterprise adoption, with a strong emphasis on reliability, real-time performance, and security compliance.

My background blends deep technical execution with product leadership and customer engagement across B2B and B2C domains. I’ve built industrial IoT platforms for lean manufacturing and energy management, and niche training tools used directly by professional communities.
