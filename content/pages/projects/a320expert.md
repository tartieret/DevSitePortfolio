### Project Background

A320 Expert is a B2C training platform built during the Covid period to support Airbus A320 pilots preparing for type ratings, recurrent training, and knowledge refreshers.

The project was developed in collaboration with a close friend, a professional A320 pilot who was temporarily grounded at the time. The platform combines real-world operational expertise from line pilots with a structured, software-driven training experience focused on practical knowledge, systems understanding, and realistic scenarios.

Unlike my enterprise and industrial work, A320 Expert was designed as a niche B2C product for a highly specialized audience. It currently serves around 200 monthly active users and is well known within the A320 pilot community as a trusted supplemental training tool.
