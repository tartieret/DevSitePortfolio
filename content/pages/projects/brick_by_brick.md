## Project description

My colleague Hatef Rahmani and I took part to the Brick to Brick 2024 challenge organized on AI Crowd by UNSW Sydney. The goal of the challenge was to classify building data streams into categories defined by the Brick schema. Using time-series data, including sensor readings and equipment statuses, we had to organize and standardize this information to streamline management processes. 

This was a challenging task due to the number of classes and time-series. You can find the full code and documentation in the GitHub repository, and a engineering report is available [here]().
