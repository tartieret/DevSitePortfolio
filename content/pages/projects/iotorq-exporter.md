### Project Background

At [Panevo](https://www.panevo.com), I led the development of a new data platform for industrial energy management called ioTORQ, from a blank page to successful deployments at large industrial sites (PepsiCo, Saputo, Finning, BC Ferries...).

Streaming data from thousands of metering devices is sent to the platform every minute. Our clients can then explore the data, build dashboard and corporate reports, and find insights to enhance their environmental performance.

The architecture of this ETL software is largely inspired from [Apache NIFI](https://nifi.apache.org/)
