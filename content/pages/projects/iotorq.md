### Project Background

At [Panevo](https://www.panevo.com), I led the development of a new data platform for industrial energy management called ioTORQ, from a blank page to successful deployments at large industrial sites (PepsiCo, Saputo, Finning, BC Ferries...).

Streaming data from thousands of IoT devices is sent to the platform every minute. Our clients can then explore their data, build dashboards and corporate reports, and find insights to enhance their environmental performance.
