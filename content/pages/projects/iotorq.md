### Cloud platform for industrial energy management

ioTORQ EMIS is a cloud-native data platform that helps industrial organizations collect, integrate, and analyze energy, utility, and operational data to improve performance, reduce costs, and support sustainability initiatives. The platform ingests streaming data from thousands of IoT devices, process historians, meters, and bill sources, and turns it into real-time dashboards, corporate reports, and insights that support decision-making at scale.

Enterprise customers use ioTORQ EMIS to monitor consumption, benchmark performance across sites, track key KPIs, automate reporting, and identify opportunities for optimization and savings.

### Challenges and platform complexity

Industrial energy management involves large volumes of heterogeneous data originating from diverse systems and formats — from utility bills and submeters to PLCs and cloud APIs. Delivering a unified, reliable, and performant view across this landscape requires a system capable of:

- Flexible data integration across devices, FTP sources, historians, and third-party systems.
- Real-time dashboards and visualization to support operational and executive needs.
- Scalable reporting and analytics for corporate benchmarking and sustainability reporting.
- Security and compliance suitable for enterprise deployments.

### My role

At [Panevo](https://www.panevo.com), I started ioTORQ EMIS as the initial and sole developer, taking the platform from a blank page to its first production deployments. The early versions were designed, implemented, and operated hands-on, covering data ingestion, analytics, visualization, and integrations, while already supporting real industrial users.

As the platform matured and adoption grew, I led its architectural evolution and scaling to support higher data volumes, additional use cases, and multi-site enterprise deployments. I later built and led the engineering team responsible for the platform, transitioning from direct implementation to technical leadership, architecture oversight, and product direction.

My responsibilities spanned both strategy and execution, including:

- Defining the overall platform architecture and long-term technical roadmap.
- Hands-on implementation of core systems for data ingestion, analytics, and visualization.
- Designing integration strategies for a wide range of industrial data sources, formats, and enterprise IT environments.
- Building enterprise-ready capabilities such as customizable dashboards, alerting, flexible APIs, locand secure user and permission management.
- Owning security, compliance, and operational reliability required by large industrial and public-sector customers.

### Features

- Fully customizable dashboards and presentations with real-time update
- Notification system with automatic alerting
- Flexible REST API
- Easy integration with multiple data sources & formats, including FTP, process historians, IoT devices, third-party APIs
- Multivariate regression modeling to define baselines
- Schematic editor for real-time monitoring of sub-systems
- Flexible user management and permission system to manage access levels
- Machine Learning module for asset optimization
- Bill consolidation: collect and aggregate billing information related to electricity, gas, water, telecom & waste
- Double offering: cloud SaaS and on-premises deployment
- Enterprise Compliance and Security (MFA, SOCII...)
