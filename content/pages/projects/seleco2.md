## Project description

The purpose of the SeleCO2 project was to study a new type of electro-thermal energy storage process for
large scale electric applications, based on transcritical CO2 cycles and ground heat storage. The key idea was to convert electricity to heat and store heat in the ground when electricity is cheap, and then convert heat back to electricity when power is needed.

The project brought together five partners: ENGIE (ENGIE Lab CRIGEN), BRGM, CEA (Liten), Enertime and IMFT. The total cost of the research project was €1,875k and the partners received a total grant of € 899k from the French National Research Agency (ANR).

As part of my role at [Enertime](https://www.enertime.com/en/), I was responsible for our activites in the project, and more precisely the design and modeling of the thermodynamic processes.

The main challenge of the project was to build an accurate transient model of the energy storage system, taking into account the physics of heat transfer in the ground heat exchanger and the dynamics of the transcritical CO2 cycles. It required to build, validate and combine several models of the subsystems.
